# js_interpreter

This package has 3 different types of properties:

- private internals, denoted with a prefix underscore
- public internals, denoted with a starting lowercase letter
- public extenals, denoted with a starting uppercase letter

This also applies to files. And ```__init__.py``` defines
some properties which also conform to that schema.

<!-- Here a property can be either a non-method attribute
     or a method. Includes getters and setters, etc. -->
