# python-ecmascript-interpreter

An implementation of ECMAScript made with Python!

The package name is currently ```js_interpreter``` which is much more convienient if you don't use autocomplete.

## IMPORTANT notes

IMPORTANT: This repo is for educational purposes only.
If you want to do stuff with JavaScript code in Python, try something else.

IMPORTANT: This implementation uses much less optimizations because of the education purposes mentioned.

IMPORTANT:

- htmlcov is generated by the python package coverage
- tests/context.py is also under a different license

## Even more notes

I'm fairly new to Python, so feel free to judge my code.

[This package guide](https://hackernoon.com/pip-install-abra-cadabra-or-python-packages-for-beginners-33a989834975) was really helpful for setting things up.

See [js_interpreter/README.md](js_interpreter/README.md) as well
